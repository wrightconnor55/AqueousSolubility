# AqueousSolubility
    Machine Learning Model to predict aqueous solubility of non-electrolyte compounds

The primary focus of this machine learning project is to be able to predict aqueous
solubility from basic chemical data, such as a molecule's weight and number of aromatic rings.
The main area of investigation is trying to obtain a suitable model with the least amount of
complex variables, i.e., chemical data that is hard to acquire experimentally. Being able to
accurately predict the aqueous solubility of a molecule would save time and money for lab
scientists. The steps to experimentally determine aqueous solubility can be costly in terms of
time, depending on the procedure one uses. Therefore, allowing one to predict aqueous
solubility with easily acquired data will be beneficial.
